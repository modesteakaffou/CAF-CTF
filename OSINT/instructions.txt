You work for a Reputed OSINT company. One day you got a mail from your boss telling you: “You have given a screenshot from a popular Web seris. You have to run proper open source investigation to find out the name of the web seris,episode number, episode name, IMDB rating of that specific episode.’’

Flag format: CAF_{WebserisName_SeasonNumber_EpisodNumber_EpisodName_IMDBrating}

Note: All the characters of the Web seris name and EpisodName will be in Uppercase. IF the episode name is multiple words then separate them with underscore( _ ). Suppose the episode name is HELLO WE ARE HERE. Then the EpisodName on the flag will be: {HELLO_WE_ARE_HERE}
